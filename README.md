##  :beginner: About
This project offers an algorithmic solution to the age-old problem of reconstructing a shredded image. Leveraging Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pillow (PIL), and OpenCV, it provides a systematic approach to piece together shredded fragments of an image. The algorithm assumes equal-width shreds and operates on a grayscale representation of the image to simplify the comparison process. By identifying similarities between adjacent shreds, the algorithm progressively orders the fragments until the complete image is reconstructed.
